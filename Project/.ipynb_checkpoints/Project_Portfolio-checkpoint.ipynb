    "The Research Portfolio is a technical writing portfolio blog intended to _teach_ another NEU Master's student a techical subject related machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be the students choice whether to contribute their work to the Introduction to Machine Learning (I2ML) https://compstat-lmu.github.io/lecture_i2ml/index.html and Introduction to Statistical Learning (I2SL) https://github.com/nikbearbrown/I2SL projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the course Introduction to Machine Learning (I2ML) https://compstat-lmu.github.io/lecture_i2ml/index.html and then you will propose something to contribute. Contributions can range from making some quiz/test questions, translating some R to python, a lab, a case study or writing an entire additional chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the I2ML and I2SL projects are the languages the are written in (I2ML is in R and I2SL is in python). I2SL will also have a number of appendices after the theorectectial course which cover the hands-on teaching of essential skills related to data science or more \"exotic\" algorthms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, MIT has a class called ’The missing semester of your computer science education’ It is a collection of things that most developers and data scientists typically teach themselves on the job such as Setting up projects on Google collab,Shell Tools and Scripting,Data Wrangling, Command-line Environment, Version Control (Git), Debugging and Profiling, Metaprogramming, Security and Cryptography.  The content is available for free at https://missing.csail.mit.edu\n",
    "\n",
    "Content MUST be written as jupyter notebooks and if you also want to contribute to I2ML then in R as an .Rmd file.  Look at Christoph Molnar's Github https://github.com/christophM/interpretable-ml-book where he uses bookdown and .Rmd files to render the book _Interpretable Machine Learning A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable_ https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/ and the course Introduction to Machine Learning (I2ML) https://compstat-lmu.github.io/lecture_i2ml/index.html We will do something very similar for I2SL.  Students will contribute to the I2SL and, once accepted, the material will be added to the I2SL course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Off the top of my head rewriting any of the chapters in I2ML and adpating it to python is fine for one or two people.\n",
